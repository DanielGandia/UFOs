# UFOs

## Overview of the Analysis:

The client's webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but sheâ€™d like to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date filter, she would like to add filter for city, state, country, and shape.

## Resources:

- Data Sources: ufo_starterCode.js, data.js, nasa.jpg, app.js, style.css
- Software: ES6+ in Visual Studio Code 1.54

## Results:

The webpage has a table with information related to the UFO Sightings across the United States. The table can be filtered by any of the following criteria: Date, City, State, Country and Shape.

In order to use the filters, you can enter the information on the search bars for each of the criteria that you would like for the table to be filtered. I have copied an example below and selected the Date of "1/11/2010", State of "fl" and Country "us". The table was then filtered to show only two results.

### Filter Search Example

The webpage is being displayed in GitHub Pages located in the following URL: https://danielgandia.github.io/UFOs/

Below is an example of how the webpage appears in GitHub Pages.

## Summary

We have created a functioning webpage that will allow visitors to view sightings that occur in different areas. However, a drawback of the current webpage is that the data is limited to sightings that occurred in the United States and only from the first few weeks of January of 2010. The data will not be automatically updated as events happen across the country unless the data file is manually updated.

A recommendation that I would suggest is to add a banner or ticker that provides the latest news regarding UFO sightings. By doing this, visitors will be more engaged and also be informed as events occur. Another recommendation would be to have a section or tab in the webpage that has photos and videos of the sightings. Both of these will create a landing zone for those truly seeking contact.
